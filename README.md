## Choreward
In order to maintain a household, there are lots of tasks that need to be done throughout the day. However, oftentimes, these tasks get neglected. Sometimes, people get distracted and turn their attention to something else. Other times, people intentionally put off their duties, as they can often be a pain to do. And keeping track of everything that needs to get done can be messy. Choreward sets to solve these problems by giving people an incentive to do their chores. Choreward is a website where people can create a set of chores for a household. A household owner creates and manages a household, where they can add and remove users, create chores/tasks for those users, and create incentives for users. There are two types of chores. The first is list chores, which are simple tasks kept on a TODO list. The second type is object chores. These chores are tied to household objects (i.e. dishwasher, garbage bin, etc.) that can have various states (i.e. a garbage bin can be filling up, full, or needing a bag). For example, if a garbage bin is full, then the chore of “taking out the trash” is automatically created. This keeps all trash bin-related chores connected in the same location, instead of needing several independent list chores to accomplish the same effect. Every time a user completes a chore, they are awarded points. Users can redeem these points for things like profile decoration and household owner-created incentives.

To successfully implement this project, there are several features that need to be dealt with. For starters, users need to be able to create groups (called households), which are used to group all the chores needed for a certain location together. They also need to be able to create chores (both the list chores and the object chores described above) that users can accomplish. After, the household owner needs to be able to invite other users to these groups. Finally, points must be awarded to users who do these chores, and these points must be redeemable for in-site items and out-of-site rewards (determined by the household owner). If these features are implemented, then the project will be considered a success. If we have extra time, then the ability to host competitions where people can compete to see who can do the most chores within a set time period might also be added.
